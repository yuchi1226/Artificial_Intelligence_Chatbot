      "Bot: As the provided context does not include a specific user question about LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), I'll create an example question that might be asked by someone interested in using LCEL for their project and provide an answer based on what we know from the documentation. Here's how it could go:\n",
      "\n",
      "**User Question Example:**  \n",
      "\"How does LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) handle first-class streaming support, particularly when dealing with language models?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer Based on Documentation Context:**  \n",
      "The LangChain Expression Language provides robust streamed output directly from an LLM using a 'streaming' interface. This means that as the large model processes tokens at its own pace and outputs raw token chunks to your chain, these are then immediately forwarded to any streaming parser or application you integrate with it seamlessly without significant delay. The aim of this approach is not only for speed but also reliability in real-time scenarios where immediate feedback from language models can be crucial - such as chatbots or live moderation systems using LangServe servers, which fully support asynchronous chain execution through the `async_call()` function provided by LCEL.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more complex chains that might benefit greatly from access to intermediate results for debugging purposes or giving end-users updates on processing statuses, streamed output can be coupled with options allowing streaming of these values at any step in your chain - this is also well documented and integrated within the LangChain framework's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, LCEL makes it possible to have an immediate response from language models while providing functionalities like parallel execution optimization for better performance across synchronous or asynchronous calls using either Jupyter notebook interfaces (for prototyping) or deployment on a server with LangServe without code changes needed when moving into production. Additionally, LCEL offers features such as retries and fallbacks to enhance reliability at scale while providing accessibility in the form of Pydantic schemas for input/output validation purposes across your chain's operations within an ecosystem that supports LangSmith tracing for maximum observability when scaling complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bot: Given this context about LCEL, to answer a hypothetical question from the user named \"John\" who is new to using language models and wants guidance on setting up his first chatbot application with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), you might reply as follows in natural language:\n",

      "from langchain import LangChain, LLMCheatsharkExtraction # Assuming these are available in the LCEL package for interaction tracing and model extraction\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "def create_greeting_extraction(input):\n",
      "    llm = 'google-tapas'  # Replace with your chosen language model name/version, e.g., GPT3 or Google TAPAS pipeline if preferred\n",
      "    \n",
      "    response_chain = LangChain() \\\n",
      "        .call({\"message\": input}) \\\n",
      "        .extract(llmcheatshark=LLMCheatsharkExtraction())  # Optional: Use the Extraction for tracing and debugging complex chains in future use cases.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    return response_chain[0] if len(response_chain) > 0 else 'I didn't understand that, John!'\n",
      "```\n",
      "5. **Run Your Chain**  \n",
      "With LCEL supporting streaming output directly from the language model and asynchronous execution through LangServe for real-time responses in a chatbot application:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "user_input = \"Hi\"  # This is your greeting input by John or via user interface\n",
      "greeting = create_greeting_extraction(user_input)\n",
      "print(f\"ChatBot says: {greeting}\")\n",
      "```\n",
